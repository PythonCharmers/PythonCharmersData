"
30,0,"@kirstiecat Because we have quantity problems & are indecisive about which ones are the best.  Speaking for myself, anyway, haha.

"
44,0,"Passing on the Holly Miranda instore in favor of hibernating at home tonight, aka LAZY.  Sometimes I just don't have the energy.
"
45,0,"@theCameraClicks Ooh, Epcot!  I haven't been since I was a kid myself.  Do they still have Figment & the whole imagination station thing?
"
46,0,"@anikainlondon @kirstiecat ...but my favorite shots usually wind up being of musician at a pause. Sorry, I may've lost my initial thought.
"

56,0,"@dougkatz Good to see you also!  Haha, that's ok, pretty amusing stuff-just remind me never to cross your dad.
"
57,0,"Back in Jersey before 2am?  Usually I'd still be at Penn Sta at this hour.  It's a miracle!
"
58,0,"@kirstiecat I don't blame you for not getting over that entirely!  I'm annoyed at them now on your behalf.

"
61,0,"@kirstiecat I love them too - but I definitely also think they're one of those bands I needed to see once, but not necessarily over & over.

"
106,0,"It's really been too long since I've vomited somewhere embarrassing & inappropriate.  Clearly an experience I should seek to repeat often.

"
116,0,"Well that was sort of a letdown, I was hoping they might use more than 1 of the 20 photos they asked me to submit, oh well.

"
965,5,"things that make me happy: spending time with my family, e-cards & hanging out with fronds. maybe this v-day won't be such a wash after all.
"
966,5,"@closetospring awwwww!
"
967,5,"lol. my parents just ran into hot roomie, but thought he was creepy roomie so my mother gave him her death glare. oopsie.
"
968,6,"@crossbones_inc sleep well. i'm going to bed too.
"
969,6,"well, i am officially not finding the fabric i want in the colorway i want, but that's okay.
"
970,6,"@5kids4now well, and it wouldn't work for laundry, because of things like the rinse cycle
"
971,6,"@crossbones_inc i certainly will be. this baby on my lap is nearly out, and we will be transfering to the bed shortly.
"
972,6,"@crossbones_inc or not.
"
973,6,"@crossbones_inc lmao. be there in an hour.
"
974,6,"@5kids4now things like distillation or letting it settle for days.
"
975,6,"@5kids4now yeah, i was reading on how to actually soften your water in terms of how it affects laundry, and i was quite disheartened.
"
976,6,"@crossbones_inc don't you love it when your sewing starts talking to you?
"
977,6,"@crossbones_inc gory's birthday present is looking at me with neglected little eyes and saying ""hey, you, tweeting over there... AHEM!""
"
978,6,"@crossbones_inc lmao. hopefully snapdragon will be better by then. and by early, like 4? 3:30? when you want us? i has accomodation skillz
"
979,6,"@5kids4now a water softener would not affect the actual hardness of your water much. the hardness comes from dissolved limestone
"
980,6,"@crossbones_inc and all they seemed interested in was saturation and ease of using the site. never once mentioned the fabric quality
"
981,6,"@crossbones_inc i have to say, i'm disappointed. i had read one review of it where they compared it to it's competitors
"
982,6,"@crossbones_inc well that just sucks.
"
983,6,"@5kids4now yeah, we have hella hard water here.
"
984,6,"@crossbones_inc as in spoonflower suggests black be an accent color, and not a main color, bc it's weak when printed by them.
"
985,6,"@crossbones_inc yes. the color black. now i have to go back and see just what i said that was egads wrong.
"
986,6,"@5kids4now i am still hearting rockin' green, though i did have to strip after about six months.
"
987,6,"@5kids4now what are you using?
"
988,6,"@crossbones_inc i wish i could recall the other two or three sites that do fabric printing. one of them does decent black.
"
989,6,"@crossbones_inc i had heard that the black sucks it.
"
990,6,"@Dittany_shan  thatkevinsmith (don't feel like randomly @ ing people, lol.
"
991,6,"@crossbones_inc oh no! sucktastic greigegoods?
"
992,6,"@Dittany_shan yeah. it was. i squeed out loud like a fangirl.
"
993,6,"@crossbones_inc what is this ""break"" and ""vacation"" of which you speak. is it a new detergent?
"
994,6,"@Dittany_shan you know, i got RTed today by a quasi-celeb i follow like a dopey fangirl, and it kinda made my day. (kevin smith)
"
995,6,"@crossbones_inc @rockerbyebaby http://bit.ly/GDUK1 the geeky win is nearly complete.

996,6,"@Dittany_shan oh, that's just awful! wish i coul dhelp.
"
997,6,"@5kids4now @crossbones_inc yep, the psychic said so. lol.
"
998,6,"@Dittany_shan he has a nasty cold. nothing horrific, just not fun.
"
999,6,"@crossbones_inc no, but i'm sure spouse would appreciate it if i'd stop telling ""on the side"" jokes.
"
1000,6,"@Dittany_shan you're very welcome. snapdragon has been sick too.
"
1001,6,"@crossbones_inc it was a very bad and inappropriate joke. lol.
"
1002,6,"@crossbones_inc these jokes are one day going to get me in trouble.
"
1003,6,"@crossbones_inc and not the short guy i'm seeing on the side. lol
"
1004,6,"@crossbones_inc what? no, i'm not done. i think i have at least one more little geek in me.
"
1005,6,"@5kids4now ah. that is a difficult position in which to find oneself
"
1006,6,"@Dittany_shan oh honey, i'm sorry that your week hasn't been pleasant. *hugs*
"
1007,6,"@5kids4now totally understandable. I just can't believe I'm done.
"
1008,6,"@posielove not yet. still a little snot factory of cuteness.
"
1009,6,"@5kids4now but nonetheless, i enjoyed the sweet motion all the more knowing i would miss it.
"
1010,6,"@5kids4now you know, with snapdragon i didn't believe, truly believe, that it was the last time.
"
1011,6,"@posielove we only meet once a month and snapdragon was coming down with something so we passed.
"
1012,6,"so, i missed LLL this month. really really hoping i don't miss it again next.
"
1013,6,"@5kids4now i loved the hiccups because they were constant movement.
"
1014,6,"@nicolemarr *hugs* enjoy your dinner!
"
1015,6,"@nicolemarr er, i mean, feed himself. yeah. that. and he is mostly keen to nurse when he can manhandle me first.
"
1016,6,"@nicolemarr LOL. Snapdragon was eating really well, lots of mushed up things, but now insists on only eating things he can throw.
"
1017,6,"@nicolemarr gosh, time goes fast. how old is penny these days?
"
1018,6,"@nicolemarr a great big nine months old.  he's taken to tossing cheerios at passers by.
"
1019,6,"@nicolemarr how have you been doing?
"
1020,6,"@nicolemarr case and point, i could have sworn i had some sitting right beside my computer the other day... and now it isn't there anymore.
"
1021,6,"@nicolemarr lol. i have spent a good many hours hunting up packing tape in my life. it's always a ""i just saw it!"" frustration
"
1022,6,"@nicolemarr it is good to see you on. *hugs*
"
1023,6,"@zealandsmom1 a woman in my LLL meeting gets domperidone imported.
"
1024,6,"@shaylan_ i'm really happy for you then. i find moving very daunting, but usually quite worth it.
"
1025,6,"@shylan a birthday diaper! how exciting!!!
"
1026,6,"@shaylan_ that sounds downright awesome
"
1027,6,"@shaylan_ i've been hangin' in here. and you?
"
1028,6,"@shaylan_ it was me. that's how i saw that someone did. lol
"
1029,6,"my interwebz sweater idol is posting more rainbow sweaters on saturday at 9pm eastern. why am i even going to stalk. i has no $ to buy lol
"
1030,6,"@kitchenwitch see why i think its nutty?
"
1031,6,"@kitchenwitch http://bit.ly/cTD0Yr we did a fibrearts segment every year bc our teacher was a fiber artist
"
1032,6,"@kitchenwitch now i'm just itching to do it for spite.
"
1033,6,"@kitchenwitch well, i didn't make precisely this, but something v similar. i mean, i didn't even WANT one til i saw that notice.
"
1034,6,"@desireefawn yeah. pinch in center and twist til it's a tight disk. but then when i put the die on, i think i just don't saturate well 'nuf
"
1035,6,"@doudoubebe it's kinda terrifying thesorts of dangerous products and info out there.
"
1036,6,"@doudoubebe i keep thinking i might use the strap for something.
"
1037,6,"@doudoubebe i never put snapdragon in it, and i didn't give it to goodwill for fear someone would use it!
"
1038,6,"@doudoubebe ah yes. i own one of those.
"
1039,6,"@doudoubebe before i click the link that sounds like an airway problem waiting to happen.
"
1040,6,"@desireefawn i thought that was how you did a bullseye pattern. i've done spirals, but they always look... well, pitiful.
"
1041,6,"@doudoubebe i suppose it was passive aggressive of me to let it go.
"
1042,6,"@doudoubebe in this case it was my SIL who doesn't like to be told anything and who calls me ""young and dumb""
"
1043,6,"@doudoubebe i don't even know what a bag sling is!
"
1044,6,"any tie dye masters out there want to explain how you get the really perfect spirals?
"
1045,6,"@doudoubebe i should get involved or just let her be the master of her own universe. kwim?
"
1046,6,"@doudoubebe yes. that is certainly the truth. though i once saw a woman babywearing in a way i knew would hurt her back, but didn't know if
"
1047,6,"@crossbones_inc exactly! @dittany_shan needs to send out some cards. we needs them, we do.
"
1048,6,"@ThriftyMamaB yes. really, we only know the grandmother, else i'd probably be unable to talk about it at all.
"
1049,6,"@doudoubebe so i'm sure you see why i'm not willing to be making slings to sell people.
"
1050,6,"@ThriftyMamaB i even think that i've read babywearing directions which specifically state not to do just that.
"
1051,6,"@ThriftyMamaB yeah. can't imagine that the fumes of the mower were good on the lungs/o2 levels.
"
1052,6,"@doudoubebe but i really feel that the most important part is end user knowledgability  and vigilence.
"
1053,6,"@doudoubebe right. and some of the MAJOR manufacturers make some of the LEAST safe slings.
"
1054,6,"@ThriftyMamaB but i'd hate to be the sling manufacturer if someone decides to go down that line.
"
1055,6,"@ThriftyMamaB but then the grandma is all ""babywearing is dangerous"" and i'm thinking ""lawnmower exhaust is dangerous...""
"
1056,6,"@ThriftyMamaB or there is this family i know where the dad was babywearing while mowing. and the baby died. ruled ""daytime sids""
"
1057,6,"okay, done whining about something that is kinda nice. lol.
"
1058,6,"@ThriftyMamaB thank you, and i'd like to think that i do. :-) it helps that the print i chose for mine is teh awesome.
"
1059,6,"@ThriftyMamaB and considering that i came very close to dropping snapdragon once... and i know what i'm doing...
"
1060,6,"@ThriftyMamaB and i'm always tempted to say yes, but then i remember that people can be stupid.
"
1061,6,"@ThriftyMamaB okay, maybe half the times i'm out, but still, it's a lot.
"
1062,6,"@ThriftyMamaB every time i am out wearing the baby, someone asks if i'd make and sell them one.
"
1063,6,"so if you ask me, i'll direct you to my friend's website, because she's not scared of business liability insurance premiums.
"
1064,6,"i know-mean. but to buy quality fabric, and assume workmanship liability when your kid goes in it... i'd have to charge too much
"
1065,6,"dear everyone. i will not sell you a sling. yes, mine rocks it old school.  yes, it's the best one ever. no, i will not sell you one.
"
1066,6,"frankly, ""if immitated in any way there will be legal action taken"" makes me want to make one for myself. why? because it's not very hard
"
1067,6,"when you see something you made something very similar to in 5th grade with the words ""illegal to reproduce this design"" one thinks #fail
"
1068,6,"@dittany_shan or loves the skidpants
"
1069,6,"@dittany_shan i straight up need a bunch of your cards so i won't have to keep writing down your info every time someone wants a pouch sling
"
1070,6,"@rockythezombie $ to fight with anyone on it. it'd be like if decided i'd pattented using yarn to make a blanket.
"
1071,6,"@rockythezombie especially considering almost every piece of clothing i own has one. i suspect it's not a valid patent, but no one has the
"
1072,6,"@rockythezombie yes, but all the ribbon loops had to go bye bye due to some alleged pattent by taggie.
"
1073,6,"@rockerbyebaby ???? http://bit.ly/9Zq5sm
"
1074,6,"DD msgs me on FB. ""r u on?"" me ""is your homework done?
"
1075,6,"@nikinic29 yes. should be, but 1 didnt work 4 someone
"
1076,6,"@HeHasMyMittens lol. yes. that. sewing is really quite easy
"
1077,6,"that awesome free ship thing from @rockythezombie? it's here: http://bit.ly/bAv4wL last link was fail. sorry.
"
1078,6,"@rockythezombie dangit. will fix shortly. stupid link shortener.
"
1079,6,"OMG! Free shipping from @rockythezombie!!!! http:/http://bit.ly/11aape talk about awesome on your doorstep!
"
1080,6,"@HeHasMyMittens i've thought of using regular weight fabric to make one, but i fear that i'd have trouble with nipple bumps if not 2xthick
"
1081,6,"@missemmielou i have one! it's kinda awesome because it's a ""for mother's comfort"" cover, not a blanket type.
"
1082,6,"@HeHasMyMittens http://bit.ly/byCa4x this dress. i may have already shown it to people. lol.
"
1083,6,"@npjohnson spending next to nothing is a difficult thing to do, but it has some rewards.
"
1084,6,"@HeHasMyMittens because the shape i would cut is like a just under 6""circle and a 50x20"" piece.
"
1085,6,"@HeHasMyMittens $20, and definitely big enough.
"
1086,6,"@HeHasMyMittens lets see, it's $6/yard, at 54"" wide, and i'd need.... hm. four yards. slightly cheaper to do the 8x11 dropcloth, which is
"
1087,6,"@HeHasMyMittens i have these awesome canvas dresses, and i want another two of them, and i think that'd work better than yardage.
"
1088,6,"@HeHasMyMittens i like the way you think.
"
1089,6,"@rockythezombie i still have the disk to install, but because i had to install it a bunch of times on my crapputer, not sure if usable.
"
1090,6,"@rockythezombie i had it in microsoft digital image pro. it was very good for simplifying images for quilting. whee. thanks for the rec
"
1091,6,"found one done with only five or six... but that might be too limited for me. silly me.
"
1092,6,"@Wonderkarin i'm into science enough i'd have been all over it.
"
1093,6,"@Wonderkarin well that's pretty cool.
"
1094,6,"@Wonderkarin unless of course snapdragon is the mail man's....
"
1095,6,"@Wonderkarin we have determined that spouse is O+ bc snapdragon is B+, his mom is o+, and all the sudden she remembered his dad was 0-
"
1096,6,"@Wonderkarin how did they determine it?
"
1097,6,"@hehasmymittens i want to get one to make a canvas dress out of and tie dye it. because i'm weird like that.
"
1098,6,"@HeHasMyMittens google the fiber content and ""how to dye"" for recommendations of types of dyes and whether to pretreat.
"
1099,6,"@HeHasMyMittens yes. you absolutely can. it's all about fiber content & it should be cotton.
"
1100,6,"@Wonderkarin my mom is o -, my dad b+, so i'm b- & we consider it my outlook on life, lol.
"
1101,6,"@Wonderkarin most definitely woul dhave to be negative.
"
1102,6,"@Wonderkarin i won't be quite so concerned now.
"
1103,6,"@Wonderkarin ah. so you would be given my blood if you were in the hospital, and it'd be all good.
"
1104,6,"@Wonderkarin what happens if you need blood and they don't have any becuase they turn your type down?
"
1105,6,"@Wonderkarin what blood type could be so rare as to mess up the system? that's nutty!
"
1106,6,"@phdinparenting id think shipping is better- no ""lost luggage"" concerns
"
1107,6,"ok, i had a program that used to take a picture and do a 8 color version of it, looked v pop art. what is technique called?
"
1108,6,"@newwife777 right. i made my own wipes too.
"
1109,6,"@newwife777 yeah, but i'm not the kind of jerkwad who would do that, unless it were so common an item that there'd be no reason to wonder
"
1110,6,"@madreoso ooh, and winter is winding up. i wonder if i'll be able to find any good deals.
"
1111,6,"@BevKnits true enough that.
"
1112,6,"@madreoso then the actual sewing part.
"
1113,6,"@madreoso three  prowl the local goodwill and salvation army stores.
"
1114,6,"@madreoso step two. learn to use my mom's overlock stitch on her sewing machine, since i lack a serger.
"
1115,6,"@madreoso yes. i really really do need to do this. step one- go through my own damn sweaters and find candidates for cutting up.
"
1116,6,"@dontpatthebelly precisely.
"
1117,6,"@madreoso http://bit.ly/agAnUa it's sooooo pretty.
"
1118,6,"@dontpatthebelly because it'll be hard and time consuming? and still cost 1/3 the price in materials?
"
1119,6,"@madreoso a maternity sweater in 2008.  and it was the only thing i bought for maternity.
"
1120,6,"@madreoso dear lord, yes i would. but alas, i haven't had money for any new clothing items in a LONG time. last thing i bought myself was
"
1121,6,"@BevKnits yep, and i think i can do it the way i am envisioning with 12-15 sweaters, which is less than original 18-20 guesstimate.
"
1122,6,"@madreoso but hers are the ones that make my heart sing.
"
1123,6,"@madreoso yeah, i wouldn't be selling, nor precise copying, not that there aren't other people making them.
"
1124,6,"@BevKnits well, it'll be a while. gathering sweaters will take time, and getting cozy with my mom's overlock stitch...
"
1125,6,"@BevKnits i want. http://bit.ly/cuQwWI
"
1126,6,"is it ethically a bad thing to see something  creative you love, and make your own variation of it for just yourself instead of buying one

1127,6,"@MommyGeekology totally make sense.

1128,6,"@MommyGeekology btw, i tweet from the bathroom all the time
"
1129,6,"@MommyGeekology so glad you stayed dry.

1138,6,"@AppleCheeksDipe exactly.
"
1139,6,"@AppleCheeksDipe ooh, she has an awesome one she did with only 14. now my brain is working.
"
1140,6,"my xSIL gave us a bunch of 24m 3t & 4t boys clothes. Looks like all snapdragon will be needing is bottomings.
"
1141,6,"@paisleyduchess thanks.
"
1142,6,"@AppleCheeksDipe here it's salvation army and goodwill. :-)
"
1143,6,"@AppleCheeksDipe for the one i heart so much she used 18 different sweaters. see? i'm encouragable.

1151,6,"when did i get so birthy?
"
1152,6,"@AppleCheeksDipe why am i talking myself into this? what would i do with the scraps of plenty? make psuedo sock monkeys?
"
1153,6,"@AppleCheeksDipe and then i'm looking at 60, unless i do a reciprocating colorway instead of a gradient, and then i'm prolly down to 45...
"
1154,6,"@AppleCheeksDipe but then again, i suppose i have some sweaters i don't wear, so i could prolly cut down on how many sweaters i need by 5
"
1155,6,"@AppleCheeksDipe but i'm going to admit that though i totally understand the construction, that notion makes me nervous.
"
1156,6,"@AppleCheeksDipe now, my mom has an overlockish stitch on her sewing machine, and that's tempting, brings it down to about 75...
"
1157,6,"@AppleCheeksDipe i'd be looking at at least 260, plus the thread. so now i'm looking at 275.
"
1158,6,"@AppleCheeksDipe :-) i am in heart with it.  but i'd need a serger, and about 20 sweaters. at 200 for a cheap serger and 3/sweater...
"
1159,6,"@EcoChic good deal, and good luck.
"
1160,6,"@AppleCheeksDipe i love that she thrifts sweaters and upcycles them
"
1161,6,"@AppleCheeksDipe i look at her etsy shop and her website all the time. http://bit.ly/cCblfL http://bit.ly/a1RSEa and am all wistful.
"
1162,6,"@EcoChic that's the key.  being part of the solution.

"
1293,7,"@ClearlyAM Enough of the #smug!
"
1294,7,"So, Google Buzz is not that good? Why? Because, fundamentally, their business model doesn't need it to be. Compare Apple's polished products
"
1295,7,"@BenjaminEllis @solobasssteve @suw Also the thin spread of talent across so many products. Microsoft, Cisco all over again, no surprise...

"
1383,8,"@Giapo ah! Thank you for that, will try to make it on WEd :)
"
1384,8,"@AdageBusiness will keep an eye on Giapo.  I sometimes sing in the car, with the windows close, down the motorway lol! couldn't do it public
"
1385,8,"@jeanettemarsh yes wish I could sing too, my favourite is opera, Carrera, Domingo, Bocelli...
"
1386,8,"@AdageBusiness Yes I'm in Ak, @Giapo does karaoke? sounds like a good idea
"
1387,8,"@AdageBusiness hey that's fabulous! Getting a compliment from someone like that says a lot :) you should just keep singing
"
1388,8,"@AGirlCalledKate I luv going out to restaurants and cafes, makes me smile :)
"
1389,8,"@AdageBusiness mum took singing lessons, but she stopped b/c she wanted to sound just like grandma, But the family compares that's for sure
"
1390,8,"@AdageBusiness mmhhh yes, my aunts sing quite well, but after hearing my grandma they just quietly sing in the shower..
"
1391,8,"@AGirlCalledKate Rum Pannacotta w/ Raspberry curd, yoghurt sorbet and Garibaldi biscuits... SOUNDS DELICIOUS!

"
1395,8,"@AdageBusiness lol! I don't even sing in the shower  My mother said once ""stop singing darling"" hehehe, though I would luv to sing like that
"
1396,8,"@AdageBusiness this one I saw was a retro style if I'm not mistaken

"
1398,8,"@AdageBusiness lol! sounds like we have similar families.  Doesn't their voice just lift you up? luv to get me some classics
"
1399,8,"@AdageBusiness I saw this turntable in a 2nd hand shop, by whitcoulls, I was all excited when the shop owner said ""sorry, not for sale""
"
1400,8,"@AdageBusiness sounds like P. Domingo 'only' in that song though, not the others, at least I confused them just now
"
1401,8,"@AdageBusiness how fabulous it is to have a singer in the family, you can hear these songs 'live' while peeling the potatoes :) magic
"
1402,8,"@AdageBusiness Mario Lanza sounds like Placido Domingo
"
1403,8,"@AdageBusiness oh I love that! listening to it right now, perfect.  My grandma is an opera singer, so this music was always heard, thank u!
"
1404,8,"I can feel the humidity INSIDE my head
"
1405,8,"@AGirlCalledKate Is Mr C already showering you with flowers and chocolates? or did something like that start last night ;)
"
1406,8,"@eileen_harris so are your curls natural?! (go on tell us) they look great on your photo avatar.
"
1407,8,"@AdageBusiness Innovation absolutely! and with that kiwi attitude that I luv so much of getting the work 'done', very effective
"
1408,8,"@AGirlCalledKate Morning Kate, I'll be going to Alberton http://bit.ly/bw2R13 Historic House.  But nothing 'Valentiny'.. I have no Valentine
"
1409,8,"@AdageBusiness exactly! that's what it is, its not moving forward, I thought I was being demanding.  I""m from Chile so I'm tolerant :)
"
1410,8,"@eileen_harris Though I must say I luv my curls, its the frizzy little ones on top of my head that drive me wild, because I look 'wild'
"
1411,8,"@eileen_harris I would love to see it for myself after 3 weeks, but on someone else first :)
"
1412,8,"@eileen_harris interesting! I've heard something about sheep wool and straight hair but I thought I had misunderstood... I mean really.
"
1413,8,"@jeanettemarsh oh, so your overnight sleep wasn't too good then.  You can sleep in, weather is not helping, u won't miss much :)
"
1414,8,"@AdageBusiness Right, got it.  I wonder how many will be leaving for Australia now, I know so many myself that left last year
"
1415,8,"@AdageBusiness when u say 'scaled' what do you mean?
"
1416,8,"@AdageBusiness yes, if it works for them I don't know why it shouldn't work for us, 10% sounds wonderful
"
1417,8,"@AdageBusiness Well I'm looking forward to the Budget that's for sure.  The rise on GST was an unpleasant surprise
"
1418,8,"@AdageBusiness Too nice maybe. I would love detailed explanation of the tax reform, that wld be interesting, what do they see that I don't?
"
1419,8,"@jeanettemarsh ouch! not a nice way to wake up... Morning! ;)
"
1420,8,"Its Valentine's Day so I'm expecting lots of flowers and chocolates, my address is 83 S....
"
1421,8,"@AdageBusiness but he needs more knowledge than he currently has, no time to learn now.
"
1422,8,"@AdageBusiness overall I find him trustworthy, honest and a desire to learn...
"
1423,8,"@AdageBusiness some ppl walk into a room and know what's going on, he doesn't.  He lacks knowledge, he's not wise and he has become a puppet
"
1424,8,"@AdageBusiness Don't think he is very effective, the job is too big for  him.  He is missing that 'awareness instinct' u know?
"
1425,8,"@AGirlCalledKate Morning! :)
"
1426,8,"@AdageBusiness lol! true, he is the most charming.  Morning :)
"
1427,8,"@jshe halo halo!  morning ;)

1432,8,"Just found out I'm a tiger.  In the Chinese zodiac I mean ;)
"
1433,8,"@cameocreams mhhhh thanks for that... I think I'll skip it :) Sounds like candy than chocolate really, I'm a serious choc fan
"
1434,8,"@dahara lol! that's a good one!
"
1435,8,"Roasting veges for lunch, having an abundant salad.  I feel like having carrot juice, I'm turning into a rabbit
"
1436,8,"@AGirlCalledKate Well if it does the trick then I guess Mr C has no say ;) unless he cleans the kitchen!
"
1437,8,"@cameocreams I didn't know about a yellow store, though I have heard about a yellow chocolota, is it real chocolate?
"
1438,8,"@AGirlCalledKate Maybe if you put some funky music will help cleaning the kitchen fun?
"
1439,8,"@impossiblecat its exactly what I'm thinking right now... and I live in Auckland!

1448,8,"@jeanettemarsh eh no, not the powder.... you have a point.. a very good point.  That may do the trick, helps the crazy craving
"
1449,8,"@cafe_chick @jeanettemarsh I never really keep chocolate because I don't stop until I eat it all.. ALL! So I just buy it when I crave it
"
1450,8,"@jshe ah! hehehe I thought it would have something to do with Clooney... yes I know, silly me
"
1451,8,"@eileen_harris I seem to have many rivals for George.  Shall include Lake Como on my trip this year. Will send pics.  Who wants to join me?
"
1452,8,"I feel like having something chocolaty.  Brownie maybe, a triple chocolate cake, a chocolate bar, chocolate mousse.  I have no chocolate
"
1453,8,"@jshe right.  I don't celebrate it :) why?
"
1454,8,"@jshe what is CNY? (sorry i should probably know that)

"
2531,14,"@Vikram_Sood Just readiyr blog post of 13/2. Very nice. It begs one question. That China will remain monlithic. or India. What then?
"
2532,14,"Pak has been a proxy war by China to contain India. Internal destabilising of Pak is probably an Indian ploy.
"
2533,14,"@virsanghvi They'll attack us
"
2534,14,"@virsanghvi And a deal breakdown of keeping terms will be catostrophic to Pak (or India) hence Mutual deterrance
"
2535,14,"@virsanghvi No deal will add global condemnation of Pak. A Deal will mean peace & progress
"
2536,14,"@virsanghvi We Ppl should be DEMANDING GOI have MEANINGFUL n STRONG talks for a change. Not defensive, but offensive talks!
"
2537,14,"@virsanghvi Why an ""or"" is implied instead of letting covert & overt military + security STRENGTHEN n give teeth to our talks?
"
2538,14,"@virsanghvi Fair. Suggest that we (public) dont KNOW that there arent covert ops happening. Thats all. If we did, they wouldnt be covert :)
"
2539,14,"@anooprk07 If covert ops is know, then they wont be covert :)
"
2540,14,"@virsanghvi Doesnt that imply that covert ops will 'succeed' or 'settle' the problems? How do we know?
"
2541,14,"@virsanghvi Consider? Are you telling us we arent already 'in action' these last 60 years? LOL
"
2542,14,"@4quamarine Yes U didnt say wait for 60 yrs. But waiting for Pak to take corrective measures BEFORE we respond has so far taken 60 :)
"
2543,14,"@amaninder_singh GN.
"
2544,14,"@4quamarine True. And I'm saying lets take the initiative for another 60 years. We;ve LOST nothing. Gained world respect.
"
2545,14,"@4quamarine At the 'end' of the play, the results will tell us whether it 'worked' or not. Right wrong is righteousness
"
2546,14,"@4quamarine Oh no, not at all. Yr choice is equal to waiting another 60 yrs, mine is not. Thats all. There's no 'right' or 'wrong' in either
"
2547,14,"Actually I see myself actually repeating many of the things the Pak's are saying :)
"
2548,14,"@4quamarine This 'pehle aap' toh bandh karna hai abhi.
"
2549,14,"@amaninder_singh Hmm... no I meant Pak is in economic chaos. Free trade can be high leverage in return for peace.
"
2550,14,"@4quamarine after 60 years, U call it 'desparate' or 'rash'? So would another 60 yrs be okay?
"
2551,14,"@amaninder_singh sry, dont see the connection?
"
2552,14,"@4quamarine so then that leaves us DEMANDING meaningful talks, right?
"
2553,14,"@amaninder_singh True. Thats where U and I and all our friends come in. Dont blame GOI if we arent serious enough.
"
2554,14,"@4quamarine Great, but WHy the ""or"" instead of ""and"" ?? Why shld one be at the cost of the other? How do we know its not being done?
"
2555,14,"@anooprk07 yes, and it seems that one such opportunity was lost b'cause Musharraf got into trouble
"
2556,14,"@amaninder_singh We will have to make it un-worthwhile for terror to be 'sponsored'. MONEY is an important catalyst these days.
"
2557,14,"@4quamarine Name one ""something""
"
2558,14,"@amaninder_singh fortunately today we have alternbatives to 'media'. The media will follow social activism if they see Ppl hot on a subject
"
2559,14,"@amaninder_singh Theres no such thing as unbiased media. But yes, public opinion can force govt to act and settle.
"
2560,14,"@amaninder_singh If we think in terms of 'losing' or 'winning', then NO talks can succeed. Every thing has its cost. Whats important?
"
2561,14,"@4quamarine The way to FORCE meaningful talks is to persist unremitingly till all sides have NO option. Halfmeasures dont work
"
2562,14,"@anooprk07 Why not launch a PUBLICITY PR campaign aimed at Pak PEOPLE by GOI?
"
2563,14,"@amaninder_singh Boss, lets DEMAND meaningful talks from OUR government. Call Pak's challenge in its own space
"
2564,14,"@anooprk07 Talk to anyone at all. in fact talk to ALL. the power of vox populi is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; terror.
"
2565,14,"@virsanghvi NO! The ONLY way to defeat terrorism, whether part of pak establishment or not, is the SETTLE our disputes with give & take
"
2566,14,"@ud_iitd @ssarbjit Godo evening gentlemen! Yes, thanks. Have had a hectic weekend and thought I'd meetup on twitter
"
2567,14,"The whole point is that the ONLY way to defeat terrorism is to get Ppl into a peaceful exchange.
"
2568,14,"Despite all the 'obvious' links alleged between the terror being sponsored by elements in the Pak establishment, I support MEANINGFUL talks

2585,14,"@trivedipankaj Thanks to media hype (for TRPs) this failure of governance is being spotlighted. Leads to faster change! Democracy works
"
2586,14,"@trivedipankaj If govt dont act, Ppl MUST come out to protest & make Gov act. I agree, we hav a failure of governance ALL OVER India
"
2587,14,"@trivedipankaj Now the Maha Gov has set a precedent that'll hopefully make them act with more consistency having seen ""votes"" on the streets
"
2588,14,"@trivedipankaj Good point. Like I said democracy needs an issue / person to rally around. SRK/MNIK was that catalyst &gt;&gt;&gt;
"

"
2590,14,"@trivedipankaj Hmmm if you say so. Ppl arent fools even if it takes more time and disgust to get them to stand up
"
2591,14,"@trivedipankaj Thats not true. The hype was abt FREEDOM and Rights for ALL people. And against Goondaism Blindness of ""champions of Hindutva
"
2592,14,"@trivedipankaj If thats yr view, how come U dont hav 1 thing to say abt the sena's goons? The bundhs and all dont 'waste' India's wealth??

"
3996,21,"@NickJMyFirefly nevermind xP leave it in the past xP lol so was up ??
"
3997,22,"@canyonsdave I think failure should be a learning experience. Getting a nice medal doesn't fit that formulation.
"
3998,22,"@amichetti I am a simple man when it comes to sports. I have enough complexity in the rest of my life.
"
3999,22,"@amichetti I don't watch that eighter. I like luge, bobsled, Nordic combined, speed skating and other less esoteric sports.
"
4000,22,"@oline73 If that means that the rich must get taxed more than the poor, so be it.
"
4001,22,"@oline73 I am making the point that all students should have equal facilities, equal resources and equal opportunity.
"
4002,22,"@oline73 What local control are you talking about. There is no local control. Only local taxation.
"
4003,22,"@librarybeth @amichetti Like I said, I like transparent scoring.
"
4004,22,"@MattheaMarquart I looked at your blog before I decided to follow you. Its what convinced me, but apparently you stopped following me.
"
4005,22,"@jonbecker If this last couple don't win the gold the contest is fixed.
"
4006,22,"@kidscrafts Admired, yes. Given a medal, no.
"
4007,22,"@oline73 All I need to see is the difference between the middle school where I live and the one where I teach. Inequity is NOT an accident.
"
4008,22,"@jonbecker I like sports where the scoring is obvious, transparent and reviewable by replay.
"
4009,22,"@jonbecker The other performances must have looked like me trying to dance.
"
4010,22,"@jonbecker I picked my head up at the first fall and wanted to see how it would be scored. Another fall and they still go into 1st place?
"
4011,22,"@ApsatParentella Likewise. It should be an interesting panel.
"
4012,22,"@oline73 Because schools are not designed the way you think they are. There is a deliberate effort to maintain class distinctions.
"
4013,22,"Why I pay no attention to figure skating: a performance with two falls and numerous errors still earns a medal.
"
4014,22,"Teachers teach what they will, but students ALWAYS have a choice about what they learn. #ecosys
"
4015,22,"@cybraryman1 The idea of universal IEPs is one that @irasocol introduced me to.
"
4016,22,"@thenewtag In an ideal situation all students have an individual education plan that is fully implemented. #ecosys
"
4017,22,"@thenewtag Not allowed to; encouraged to. The problem is not the teachers, its the leadership, starting with the President. #ecosys
"
4018,22,"@thenewtag We were talking about schools, not jobs. At jobs people steal the office supplies. Its a timid form of communication. #ecosys
"
4019,22,"Mandate behavior? Are you serious? Behavior is communication. Do you mandate what people can say? #ecosys
"
4020,22,"@sourcepov The problem with models is our tendency to pick one and try to make it work for all. That doesn't work at all #ecosys
"
4021,22,"@billfromsc I think they should. You think they should. Most people say they should but don't really believe it or want it. #ecosys
"
4022,22,"Oooooh. Collies!!!!! #Westminster. I was raised by a fantastic tricolor rough.
"
4023,22,"@wmchamberlain I disagree. I think most bad practices start as what people think of as good practices, laziness perpetuates them.
"
4024,22,"@wmchamberlain School does everything it can to divest children of any intent or interest in critical thinking.
"
4025,22,"Students have few critical thinking skills because having them is punished in most schools, esp. if you think criticaly about the school.
"
4026,22,"@sourcePOV So this is a discussion of P1? #ecosys
"
4027,22,"@jennar Student-centered reform is a fantasy.  #ecosys

4028,22,"@JoyFull_deb Just read your profile and followed  you. What is suicide postvention?
"
4029,22,"@sourcePOV P8? What the heck is P8? #ecosys

4030,22,"@JoyFull_deb Damned if I know. I dropped out of school before I could be indoctrinated. #ecosys
"
4031,22,"Schools are not designed to change society, they are specifically designed to keep the elite elite and the downtrodden downtrodden. #ecosys
"
4032,22,"@thenewtag Acts always speak louder than words. Perhaps this is why many students see most adults as hypocrites. #ecosys
"
4033,22,"ALL teaching teaches values. The major purpose of education is to install society's values in children. #ecosys
"
4034,22,"@sourcePOV I'd rather think of students as people, but market views of education force identifying them as a category of the market. #ecosys
"
4035,22,"@midquel I think students should not just be students, they should be teachers and philosophers, too. #ECOSYS
"
4036,22,"@teresamiller I try to reassemble what other teachers and the system take apart. Knowledge is a web, not a slice of pie.
"
4037,22,"@teresamiller @graingered Why have any subjects in early grades. Teach holistically. All learning is connected, not in discrete pods #ecosys
"
4038,22,"@lioncaller Larger culture not the problem. 2nd language doesn't stick b/c its not an economic requirement. The world learns English #ecosys
"
4039,22,"@readtoday That opportunity gap is a creation of a racist, elitist economic system that schools are largely designed to perpetuate. #ECOSYS
"
4040,22,"@readtoday Save them from what? I try to save them from becomingCEOs who'd do anything for a profit. #ECOSYS
"
4041,22,"@mtechman I love dogs, even the one's I have to worry about crushing when I step on them. I'd just be embarrassed to be seen with those.
"
4042,22,"@readtoday Same in education. We just measure profits differently. You think of students as products, I think of them as customers. #ECOSYS
"
4043,22,"@linda704 Its a good thing you and I are many miles apart. Otherwise we'd be fighting over control of the remote.
"
4044,22,"@LindaVining I've heard ducks! (thank you Groucho)

4047,22,"@jdornberg No, they're still skating. That's why I'm back with the dogs.
"
4048,22,"@linda704 Two new breeds in herding? Have they come up with new breeds of sheep for them? #westminster
"
4049,22,"I'm so torn between watching the #olympics and @Westminster Snowboards for now, the dogs when they get past the tiny ones.
"
4050,22,"@iteachgrade2 Thanks for the RT.
"
4051,22,"@MarkShepard FYI: your link is to a post forecasting 2009 meteor showers. My current estimates of what happened last year are real accurate!

4052,22,"@michellek107 Probably not, but you have other talents.

"
4054,22,"Watching the moguls makes my knees and ankles ache.
"
4055,22,"@tperran Well, sharing a bDay w/ King Richard III and Czar Peter II certainly makes me feel better. Ghandi Groucho Marx & Bud Abbott, too.
"
4056,22,"@tperran I didn't realize that August 4th was that popular.
"
4057,22,"@tperran Cool list! Lots of variety.
"
4058,22,"@readtoday I ran a very popular bar for almost 20 years & met tens of thousands of people, but I don't usually ask folks when their Bday is.
"
4059,22,"@capohanka 2nd.
"
4060,22,"@capohanka October.
"
4061,22,"@readtoday No. Mine's in autumn, but I don't know anyone living who share's it. I know lots of cool dead people who do, though.

4065,22,"@ackstay I'm sure you will be a great support to the family. How is the twin dealing with this. It must be particularly hard on her.
"
4066,22,"@ackstay Or something like that. Is that your daughter you've been tweeting about today? My thoughts are with her.

4069,22,"@motherthinker Welcome to the bloging corps! I commented on your first post.
"
4070,22,"@sanmccarron DD got it from her mom.

4072,22,"@kchichester That's what happens when you talk to yourself &lt;vbg&gt;
"
4073,22,"New blog post: ""The Antidote to Burnout"" http://is.gd/8ooaQ
"
4074,22,"@cybraryman1 Nah, the athletes are champions. I'm just a teacher who recognizes a resource when he sees it.
"
4075,22,"@cybraryman1 They didn't bobsled in Manhattan either. Maybe I should have gone to Kingston for the opportunity to sled.
"
4076,22,"Another goldmine of info from @cybraryman1: his Olympics page has everything a teacher could ask for  http://bit.ly/8OFadG
"
4077,22,".@cybraryman1 Watching winter games as a kid I thought I wanted to B a bobsledder. Fortunately bobsled runs were'nt readily available in NYC
"
4078,22,"That luger's-view of the the course at real-time speed was harrowing! #olympics
"
4079,22,"I'm looking forward to joining @lthumann & @nwjerseyliz on the education panel at the #140conf NYC meetup on Feb 23rd.  http://is.gd/8mN0g
"
4080,22,"@sanmccarron Yes. That's putting it mildly.
"
4081,22,"@sanmccarron You saw a re-run from last spring. They lasted three months under new regime, right until the show aired for the first time.
"
4082,22,"@stewartn As opposed to events requiring electricity, no doubt.
"
4083,22,"@sapereaude The reconnection is great, just odd that its all within two hours.
"
4084,22,"@sapereaude Yes, through FB. I kept hearing stories of people connecting w/ long-lost friends but only 1 I connected w/ was @StevenEBrown
"
4085,22,"@ileducprof Also via FB. I've been in touch on-&-off w/ this student since 1977 but hadn't heard from her for about a year or so.
"
4086,22,"@ileducprof Now? 55 and still into horses. That's about all I got out of her FB profile after she friended me.
"
4087,22,"Its eerie how they all find me on the same morning.
"
4088,22,"Also heard from a student from my first teaching gig, as a volunteer in Barnstable, MA Alternative Learning Program in 1977.
"
4089,22,"Today's my day for hearing from long-lost friends: a colleague from 5 yrs ago & my first girlfriend from 40+ years ago.
"
4090,22,"@ileducprof My wife wouldn't let me put the cats out and my son, at 6'4"", is too big to lift now.
"
4091,22,"@ileducprof He's gone now. Not enough small animals in my backyard to suit him, I guess.
"
4092,22,"@DoremiGirl It was a very big thrill. I've seen one or two before much further north, but this was very close. Enjoy your day, too!
"
4093,22,"@DoremiGirl Tried to, but my camera is not good enough, my hand is not steady enough, and he refuses to turn the right way. Now he's gone.
"
4094,22,"@ackstay No, may camera doesn't have good enough telephoto. All I got was a fuzzy, semi-distant blob.
"
4095,22,"@magicdandelions They're moving into my area big time. There's a colony of immatures behind the supermarket I use.
"
4096,22,"There's a mature bald eagle sitting high in a tree on the low ridge behind my house. What a sight on President's Day weekend!
"
4097,22,"@jjash DM me, please, with the info.
"
4098,22,"@jjash I've got a new camera and a nice snow scene out my window that I'll shoot tomorrow. Should I email it? If so, where to?
"
4099,22,"@jjash I wish. I never sent you that view from my kitchen window, did I? It was you seeking it, am I right?
"
4100,22,"@jjash It was just a momentary thing when I was DMing a new follower on the web. I just hadn't seen one for a long while.
"
4101,22,"Just saw my first fail whale in a long time. I hope they're not beaching themselves again like they did in the pst.
"
4102,22,"@famousmistered @hadleyjf @CREATED2B  Thanks for the FF mentions. Lots of new followers. Must think of something useful to say. PRESSURE!!
"
4103,22,".@spedteacher54 Please fill in your bio so people will know whether they want to follow you and that we're not the same person.
"
4104,22,"@heepp AMEN!
"
4105,22,"@readtoday @mbteach @judiehaynes @MissShuganah Thanks for the follow Friday recognition.
"
4106,22,"@edtechsteve Of course, I'm also going to blog about this. I just need some time to get a little perspective and to write.
"
4107,22,"@edtechsteve I've done one better. I've written her a letter telling her how much she's affected me & how much I learn from her daily.
"
4108,22,"@mbteach I deserve dessert first every day, I'm just having it today. :-)
"
4109,22,"For those who have been following my year, this girl is one of my 8ths, very smart but very troubled. To see her smile was incredible.
"
4110,22,"@EduVulture Good weekend? This feeling should carry me to the end of June, if not into next school year.
"
4111,22,"@mtrump Me, too. I know I've affected some of my students over the years, but this was a big surprise.
"
4112,22,"@mbteach I was going to save them for after lunch but i just ate the 1st one while lunch heats. Delicious!
"
4113,22,"@sukanti I think she made a lot of days. I cant wait to tell my colleagues in the building about this. I hope they also got this gift.
"
4114,22,"@hadleyjf @aleaness I know my teachers would be surprised how fondly I remember them & what I've kept as learning for 40-odd years.
"
4115,22,"@RdngTeach @aleaness This probably would not have happened w/o all I've learned from my PLN!
"
4116,22,".@hadleyjf @RdngTeach I'll never forget this feeling & yes, having a PLN to share it w/ is awesome.
"
4117,22,"In all honesty, I thought my relationship w/ this girl was so bad I would have been afraid to eat the cookies if they came w/o the sentiment
"
4118,22,".@mbteach If I didn't share that I would have just melted into a puddle. As it is I'm still standing here stunned.
"
4119,22,".@DonaKimberly @DeborahMersino @geraldaungst @mbteach @edtechsteve @cybraryman1 @hadleyjf @avalonsensei TY I love being able to share w/ you
"
4120,22,"@StevenEBrown Paycheck? What's a paycheck? You're right, this is what keeps me coming back every day: one student seeing some light.
"
4121,22,"I'm about ready to start crying with joy.
"
4122,22,"Difficult student just brought me bag of homemade cookies & a card. Card says ""Thank you for trying to help me learn & behave. I owe you!""
"
4123,22,"@MissShuganah LOL!!! Thanks for the ff and the sympathy.
"
4124,22,"Up too early this morning so I could drive slowly & still get to work on time. I'm fading fast. Good night all, its been fun chatting.
"
4125,22,"@linda704 Its a lot more fun than having more or all the same background.
"
4126,22,"@irasocol I found out about it when some Bard alumni suggested it for my son. He's considering it while I try to find the 50K a yr it costs.
"
4127,22,"@thenewtag @cybraryman1 I'll second that nomination!
"
4128,22,"@irasocol No, but I'm talking to her mom about Simon's Rock for her in a couple of years. http://is.gd/8cC3d
"
4129,22,"@irasocol Several of them are running well ahead of me. I have one girl I want to put into HS already. Brilliant and willing to take risks.
"
4130,22,"@spam e5shea
"
4131,22,"@irasocol They had to justify why they voted for the country they favored. Top 5 went onto 2nd round of voting to pick the final 3.
"
4132,22,"@irasocol Yes. They also picked which countries we'd study from a list of E. Hemisphere possibilities I provided.
"
4133,22,"@irasocol Actually, I think Jackson Heights schools have more diversity. Each block in that neighborhood seems to be a different country.
"
4134,22,"@irasocol I'm just teaching issues like plagarism, primary sources and how to do a bibliography. A student is teaching how to build web page
"
4135,22,"@irasocol They're creating their own rubrics for their study and the rest of the class will score them according to that rubric.
"
4136,22,"@irasocol ..then will do a presentation to teach the class about that aspect of the country involved.
"
4137,22,"@irasocol My Vietnamese student is doing India, and the others are evenly distributed. Each kid answers a different open-ended question....
"
4138,22,"@irasocol Right now different groups are studying either India, China or Thailand. All my S. Asian students are doing China or Thailand.
"
4139,22,"@irasocol In this class its way more opportunities than issues. The only issues I have are among four of the the American-born students.
"
4140,22,"@irasocol I would imagine that in Astoria or Jackson Heights the ethnic mix would be considerably different.
"
4141,22,"@ktenkely I'm sure you're right. I wish they could see me now, they'd be very surprised I'm a teacher. My HS teachers'd be more surprised.
"
4142,22,"@GaryBrannigan Some parents damage their children by telling them they're stupid or that getting ""too smart"" is something to avoid.
"
4143,22,"@GaryBrannigan Many children struggle because the parents do not show they value education and set high expectations for their children.
"
4144,22,"@ktenkely I had two astounding teachers. They showed me I had intellect & taught me to not fear it. Then they taught me to use it for good.
"
4145,22,"#BlackEd Teacher expectations are essential, but parental expectations have far more impact, especially the negative ones.
"
4146,22,"@irasocol ...two Albanians, a kid from Ghana, 1 from Senegal, 1 Kenyan, 1 Nigerian, 1 Paraguayan & 1 German.
"
4147,22,"@irasocol Class has a Mexican, two from the Dom. Rep., 1 Kuwaiti, 1 Saudi, 2 Bangalas, 2 Pakistani, 3 Indians, I Viatnamese, a Canadian...
"
4148,22,"@irasocol Wouldn't surprise me. I've got 5 Bengali speakers in the class, each from a different dialect.
"
4149,22,"@NMHS_Principal My pleasure. Its not like I said anything anyone else here wouldn't say.
"
4150,22,"@MissShuganah Every now and then. This 6th grade class was my reward for all the tough ones he's given me, like my 8th grade class this yr.
"
4151,22,"@mtechman It also brings in the high-order thinking skill of evaluation, and all students can do it.
"
4152,22,"@ktenkely I have mixed feelings. Best academic yrs were middle school, but they were the worst socially. I never did get the hang of social.
"
4153,22,"@irasocol Few of these are NYC kids, 70% are here less than five years. Come from 11 different countries. Typical NYC class.
"
4154,22,"@irasocol ...as they develop industry to raise standard of living. They'll view these pics:  http://is.gd/6yLgj

"
4158,22,"@irasocol What was cool was the discussion as they decided if a newspaper was primary or not (can be both) & other tough decisions.
"
4159,22,"@irasocol The lesson is basic. A ppt about primary sources during which they did a 5-3-1, then a game sorting things as primary or not.

4162,22,"@MissShuganah It was the lesson I was going to do for my cancelled observation last week. Maybe they'll count today as an observation.
"
4163,22,"@MissShuganah ..he stepped out and called all the APs to witness the lesson on primary sources & their responses. They blew us all away.
"
4164,22,"@MissShuganah They're so bright and mostly eager to learn; just a couple of behavior issues besides chattiness. Principal dropped in today..
"
4165,22,"@MissShuganah I got invited to the dance by students. Once there I got roped in to work. I volunteered for tomorrow's b/c I love my 6ths.
"
4166,22,"@mbteach Standing there watching brought back all kinds of painful memories of my own ineptitude & massive shyness when I was their age.
"
4167,22,"@mbteach No, they just laughed at the teachers who tried. I don't dance much, and never when there's no melody.
"
4168,22,"@mtechman I just turn my mostly deaf right ear to the speakers. That and step out as often as I can. It was about 10 girls for each boy.

5157,29,"@Spirit_Helper Not a big deal, I wasn't attempting to ruffle feathers. I fly back from FLL to ATL in a week. After that I'm done with Spirit
"
5158,29,"@Spirit_Helper Members in my group were seated by the exit row and couldn't recline/had little leg room. Your seats are just very cramped.

"
5205,29,"@wesrucker Love it. Teflon John will have moved on by then as well.
"
5206,29,"Too bad the #Vols will most likely not get another shot at #1. Same team, less of a payoff with a win.

"
5208,29,"@joshutk It's Campus Connection Week so I'm the sideline reporter but I'm in the student section. Nothing major but it sounds like a blast.

"
8991,48,"All this love & confessions is making me teary eyed. Seriously.
"
8992,48,"Yeah I have soo much love in me :| @legacygirl_
"
8993,49,"Barenaked Ladies are busking in Vancouver? That is AWESOME!
"
8994,49,"@antheap On the upside, much better to be doing that in the place you're departing than the place you're arriving!
"
8995,49,"Ha! A huge ""Investigate 9/11"" sign in behind the newscast. CTV hustle out a Canada flag on hockey sticks to cover it up. Smooth.
"
8996,49,"I still kind of miss the CBC commentators but CTV has really done a good job with the web broadcasting.
"
8997,49,"Also, not to rub it in, but MAN this coverage is comprehensive. I missed the first few minutes of the interview and it's already online.
"
8998,49,"Shut up, I am not crying over the story on the sudden explosion of Canadian patriotism.
"
8999,49,"@canoeninja He is totally my new favourite. He's hot, funny, and charming. The media are going to loooooove him.
"
9000,49,"""Luge appeared to me to be trying to bring your Christmas tree in the front door the wrong way."" Why he chose skeleton over luge. Hee!
"
9001,49,"Nothing says ""I just won a gold medal"" like chugging a pitcher of beer on national TV. Awesome.
"
9002,49,"@canoeninja Oh geez, that's even worse! Holy crap, that really sucks.
"
9003,49,"Awwwwwww, Melissa Hollingsworth feels like she let down the whole country. We still love you! Don't cry!
"
9004,49,"I can't believe a Canadian got disqualified for being late. Dude, that is a stupid reason to get kicked out.
"
9005,49,"Oooh, Skeleton gets the autotune version of I Believe. How many versions of this song do they have, for god's sake?
"
9006,49,"Jon Montgomery is my new favourite Olympian. He is adorable!
"
9007,49,"Holy smokes, that was a beautiful shot. Canada is 4-0 in women's curling! Woo!
"
9008,49,"Oh geez, my two most weepy commercials in a row! Sniff. ""Hope you like pancakes, Norway."" ""Welcome to Canada.""
"
9009,49,"@learan It just went to extra ends! So much drama!
"
9010,49,"Clearly I am cheering for Canada, but the Danish outfits with the skirts are very cute.
"
9011,49,"Hard! Haaaaaaaaaaaard!
"
9012,49,"I don't usually say this, but...boy, this curling is exciting. (Don't tell my husband.)
"
9013,49,"This British skeleton winner is absolutely delightful. Nice that they're interviewing her!
"
9014,49,"Maybe there's always this much traffic! I'm just sitting on the couch instead of in my chair in the corner. My mind is blown.
"
9015,49,"There is a ridiculous amount of traffic on my street tonight. People, I live on a cul-de-sac. WTF?
"
9016,49,"@terri_to He is also hilarious. This interview is fabulous. He is going to have a goooooood time in the athlete's village.
"
9017,49,"I approve of the gold medalist shot that CTV got of Montgomery holding the flag. He is shirtless. Yowza.
"
9018,49,"I love that a car salesman with a turtle on his helmet just won a gold medal. Yay!
"
9019,49,"My sister told me today that the Vancouver library is selling cowbells. We will be purchasing one for my mother. Best souvenir ever!
"
9020,49,"@canoeninja It does seems less wildly out of control than luge, I agree. At least they can see where they're going!
"
9021,49,"Reason #700 the Olympics are extra awesome in the 21st century. Twitter tells me we win, I flip on my PVR and zip straight to watch!
"
9022,49,"@learan Oh no! What brought that on? Tell her I'm happy to be a reference.
"
9023,49,"Ok, you know I love watching skating with all y'all, but...ice dance compulsories are kind of boring.
"
9024,49,"I always forget how much more ridiculous ice dance is than other skating. Twizzles? Seriously?
"
9025,49,"@heldincontempt Yes but I think you were getting actual skating, were you not?
"
9026,49,"Huh, apparently they're scrapping the compulsories at the Olympics after this year.
"
9027,49,"Oooh Victor Kraatz is commentating. I hope he is as snarktastic as David Pelletier.
"
9028,49,"@heldincontempt I wasn't kidding about blowing bubbles on a carousel. They had a shot of that! Non-ironically!
"
9029,49,"@heldincontempt It's the intro to the Canadian ice dancers! They have been together since they were kids. The intro was RIDICULOUS.
"
9030,49,"...they are blowing bubbles on a carousel. Jesus, CTV, are they going to ride a unicorn next?
"
9031,49,"Aw, wee tiny Canadians have been skating together since she was seven! That's adorable.
"
9032,49,"Oh, I see. We had to watch Canada choke AGAIN before we could watch the skating. Sigh.
"
9033,49,"Hey, Canadians, what channel is the ice dance on? TSN is showing delayed skeleton. Sportsnet is hockey.
"
9034,49,"The people in knight costumes from Britain are very pleased with their gold medal.
"
9035,49,"Great push time for Hollingsworth! Gooo! (Do you like how watching skeleton for like three hours has made me sound like I know something?)
"
9036,49,"@terri_to Right? Flinging themselves at alarming speeds with no control. How does one get into skeleton?
"
9037,49,"Jamie's favourite part of the skeleton is when they zoom into the big pile of padding to stop. Very high tech.
"
9038,49,"What is this madness? CTV is doing a profile on an AMERICAN. My god. Someone report them to the heritage minister.
"
9039,49,"So skeleton is pretty much the most batshit crazy bananas thing you can do and still get a gold medal, yes?
"
9040,49,"SLOVAKIA WINS IT!!!!! Holy shit, what an upset. That was a HELL of a game.
"
9041,49,"@lessthanfive I know - Reading Week + Olympics = Twitter overload!
"
9042,49,"I think the crowd feels the same as I do - Slovakia is definitely getting the bigger cheers.
"
9043,49,"I don't know if I can handle another shootout, you guys. This is some tense hockey tonight!
"
9044,49,"Man, Hossa is a great player. He is playing some great heads up hockey tonight.
"
9045,49,"@agrabia I agree, but it is a huge weight off to see that Russia isn't just rolling over everyone. Not to mention the points situation.
"
9046,49,"@agrabia Hey, someone else is watching! It really has been a great game. And SO good to see Russia is not unstoppable.
"
9047,49,"And we're going to overtime! I cannot tell you what a relief it is to see Russia not completely dominating. The dream is still alive!
"
9048,49,"I may be the only one watching but holy shit this is a fantastic game!
"
9049,49,"Last three minutes of the Slovak-Russia hockey game. Suspect I am alone on my Twitter feed in watching this game intently.
"
9050,49,"I have never particularly spent much time thinking about Slovakia, but...GO SLOVAKIA!
"
9051,49,"Most unnecessary statement of the entire Olympics: ""Please stand for the national anthem."" Dude, they are all already standing.
"
9052,49,"I sort of wondered if I'd be Olympic-d out by next week. But oh my god, I am so excited to get to Vancouver. Eeeee!
"
9053,49,"HELL YES. OOMPA LOOMPA FOR THE WIN!
"
9054,49,"He is a seriously underwhelming skater. Not to mention creepy looking and kind of an ass. Oompa Loompa for the win!
"
9055,49,"I don't think Pelletier likes Plushenko very much, you guys.
"
9056,49,"That is a seriously fabulous garland, even if the marks weren't quite up to it.
"
9057,49,"(It's 9-5 in the curling, btw.)
"
9058,49,"Is it axel or axle, btw?
"
9059,49,"Man, Weir just throws himself into those axles without even building up to it.
"
9060,49,"Those are some curly eyelashes on Johnny, there.
"
9061,49,"Ok, Weir. Let's rock this thing.
"
9062,49,"Fuckin' Swiss, man. They ruin everything.
"
9063,49,"No triple axle planned? WTF? Where's the trash talk about this, hmm?
"
9064,49,"Me: ""Who's this guy?"" Jamie: ""Orlando Bloom.""
"
9065,49,"Aw, what shitty luck. He was otherwise so good! And adorable and wee.
"
9066,49,"Oh phew, just his skate broken, not his leg.
"
9067,49,"Oh NO! Adorable wee skater is hurt!
"
9068,49,"@nikkigrits I think his pants are grey.
"
9069,49,"My word, this fellow is wee. Adorable!
"
9070,49,"I wouldI like his skating so much but his HAIR IS SO FREAKY OMG. Also he is freakishly tall for a skater.
"
9071,49,"I seriously want to retweet about 70% of my feed right now. God you guys are funny.
"
9072,49,"@gingerest I just forwarded you my friend's email! (Man, Twitter is efficient tonight!)
"
9073,49,"@lauraks Thank you!!!
"
9074,49,"Wow, you guys weren't kidding about Lysacek looking Slytherin-esque.
"
9075,49,"@terri_to Martin just made a HUGE shot so now it's 9-2.
"
9076,49,"Meanwhile, this is the loudest curling audience I have ever heard in my life. Rowdy curling fans, wtf?
"
9077,49,"Holy shit five points in one shot? Damn, K-Mart. (Curling in commercial breaks chez us.)
"
9078,49,"@amyrhoda It's streaming live on ctvolympics.ca if you actually would like to watch!
"
9079,49,"@terri_to Well way to jinx him, dude.
"
9080,49,"Holy shit his triple axles are HUGE. (That's what she said.)
"
9081,49,"@justenbennett A sparkly ARGYLE sweater vest, no less.
"
9082,49,"@heldincontempt ...yet.
"
9083,49,"That is some sparkly argyle.
"
9084,49,"@terri_to Nice that Pelletier is pointing that out.
"
9085,49,"@lauraks You can email it to me if it's too complicated and/or questionably legal for Twitter. :)
"
9086,49,"Hey @lauraks - my friend @gingerest is also an ex-pat in Aus! Can you fill her in on the magic you worked to get the CTV feed?
"
9087,49,"@gingerest No no, she got a thing to watch it online through the CTV online site which is supposed to be Canadians only.
"
9088,49,"@nikkigrits Agreed. Total crazy eyes. They had a closeup of him during the opening and it freaked me out.
"
9089,49,"@gingerest My other ex-pat friend in Australia managed to find a way to watch the CTV feed. I think it cost her $6. Want me to ask her how?
"
9090,49,"""He reminds me of a young Emmanuel Sandhu!"" Oh dear, Liz, was that supposed to be a compliment?
"
9091,49,"Can I just say how much I freaking LOVE watching figure skating with Twitter? You guys are fucking hilarious.
"
9092,49,"Is he doing the Robot?
"
9093,49,"No, Liz, it is Amelie. Not Amelia.
"
9094,49,"I think my husband would rather be watching skeleton right now. What a tolerant fellow.
"
9095,49,"@terri_to Agreed. Liz Manley is ok and all, but she is far less hilarious.
"
9096,49,"I don't think Robin Hood wore sparkles, Mr. Kazakh.
"
9097,49,"This is some weird-ass music. I feel like I should be high.
"
9098,49,"Hmm. I wonder if my blood pressure has gone down enough to be able to knit.
"
9099,49,"Man, figure skating sure seems low stress in comparison now. Bring on the David Pelletier snarkery!
"
9100,49,"@nikkigrits Fair enough. You can call my husband and he can explain it to you, if you want! He is a curling fan. (As are most Canadians.)
"
9101,49,"@nikkigrits I think you need to drink a little more to understand curling. It's basically glorified shuffleboard.
"
9102,49,"@erinneo Swiss is not my favourite cheese but I DO like their chocolate.
"
9103,49,"@justenbennett @lauraks I don't know, man, I might need to lie down for a few minutes first.
"
9104,49,"@agrabia Seriously. Oh man I hope they take this as the kick in the ass.
"
9105,49,"I think I have a lifelong grudge against the Swiss now. Hopefully this was a wakeup call before we face US and Russia.
"
9106,49,"COME ON MARTY
"
9107,49,"This is the kind of situation that would make Oilers fans forgive Pronger or Heatley, btw. Just in case they were wondering.
"
9108,49,"I seriously think I am going to have a heart attack, you guys.
"
9109,49,"@gingerest What did they say about Banff?
"
9110,49,"Regardless of the outcome, we now absolutely have to beat the US on Sunday. Oh god.
"
9111,49,"Oh god shootout. I am not good with shootouts, you guys. TOO MUCH STRESS ACK.
"
9112,49,"@terri_to He's ok. He just wasn't playing and the radio was freaking out.
"
9113,49,"Come on, power play!!!
"
9114,49,"Oh good iggy played. Is crosby ok?
"
9115,49,"Oh god please don't let iginla be hurt.
"
9116,49,"Oh! It's on the radio!! Phew.
"
9117,49,"Someone keep me updated! We are driving my friend to the airport. #whatagoodfriend #lousytiming
"
9118,49,"SHIT. You're looking like the Oilers out there, Canada.
"
9119,49,"I like a good game and all but that's enough of it. A few more goals please canada!
"
9120,49,"@Booklorn 11!
"
9121,49,"@terri_to Oh my god, due to game of MINI STICKS? That is the most Canadian injury I've ever heard. Ha!
"
9122,49,"So jealous of @hello_bethie right now - she's at the long track speed skating watching Canada get the gold!
"
9123,49,"There's a move that is actually called the McTwist? Oh dear. Half pipe is hard to take seriously sometimes.
"
9124,49,"@terri_to All the snowboard commentary is sort of embarrassing. They just said posse, for god's sake.
"
9125,49,"Snowboarders have a weird combination of skater style and old man clothes.
"
9126,49,"@fuggirls It's even better in French. Less God, more epic.
"
9127,49,"@fuggirls I think my husband is secretly a Weasley. He was Percy for Halloween and it was uncanny.
"
9128,49,"You know, if my husband grew his hair out, it would look like that. Perhaps I should suggest it.
"
9129,49,"There are few things as awesome as one gold medalists and 20,000 spectators singing along to O Canada with great gusto.
"
9130,49,"By the way, Americans, I don't know how the NBC iPhone app is, but the CTV one is really excellent for quick updates and news stories.
"
9131,49,"I like the idea that the only English the Latvian team knows are swears. Ah, hockey. Bringing nations together to curse in one language.
"
9132,49,"My husband is texting his friend about curling. Soon I will get him on Twitter. I believe the current text is ""Fuck that was a good shot.""
"
9133,49,"I think this is the rowdiest curling crowd I've ever seen. It's kind of awesome.
"
9134,49,"David Pelletier being a store assistant and wailing on a giant cowbell = awesome.
"
9135,49,"@fuggirls Nothing wrong with taking curling seriously. Alas, the US did not win.
"
9136,49,"Oh dear. There goes Abbott's hopes. Too bad - I like his outfit and his non-creepiness.
"
9137,49,"He is vaguely creepy and his hair is awful but DAMN that was a fantastic skate.
"
9138,49,"@becks312 And the fake tan. But the way the hair was trying to break free during the spins...shudder.
"
9139,49,"Although I will give him credit, I LOVE the Firebird Suite.
"
9140,49,"Evan is skating very well but he sort of gives me a bad touch kind of feeling.
"
9141,49,"Is he wearing tribbles on his shoulders?
"
9142,49,"@lauraks David Pelletier rules, man. He is the best commentator ever.
"
9143,49,"What, no beret? That's a missed opportunity with this outfit. And what's with the floppy sleeve dealy?
"
9144,49,"David Pelletier does NOT approve of the sparkly skeleton ensemble.
"
9145,49,"Techno bald mountain? Ok, not so much.
"
9146,49,"Although I must admit I expect Mickey to bust out on the ice at any moment.
"
9147,49,"I heartily approve of this music choice, Mr. Skeleton Man. Night on Bal Mountain = epic.
"
9148,49,"Wow, Abbott is wearing a positively normal looking outfit. No sequins! No tassles! I kind of like it.
"
9149,49,"Is that guy warming up in a skeleton costume? Oh, figure skating.
"
9150,49,"@Doctor_Teeth Wow. I am kind of rendered speechless by that outfit. Kevin Martin SHOULD wear spangles.
"
9151,49,"Wow, that seems low. No bonus points for flair?
"
9152,49,"He is so ridiculous but this is a hell of a lot more entertaining than a lot of the routines tonight.
"
9153,49,"@nikkigrits Agreed. He is so snarky and yet charming. And also French. What's not to like?
"
9154,49,"Oh my stars. Pink tassels! Laceup corset! Wowza.
"
9155,49,"Oh man, a time violation? Brutal. Oh, Canadian figure skaters.
"
9156,49,"@Doctor_Teeth Maybe. Too bad - I like them together because they sass each other. But if I can only have one, I'd take him!
"
9157,49,"@Doctor_Teeth Oh, I'm thrilled! Just confused. I wonder what happened to Jamie?
"
9158,49,"Oh my god I love Olympics on Twitter. The simultaneous WHAT THE HELL eruption on my feed is hilarious. Seriously. Overalls.
"
9159,49,"Are those...overalls? Oh, I cannot wait for the @fuggirls to fug the figure skating outfits.
"
9160,49,"What the hell? Thought Pelletier was only doing pairs and this was supposed to be Elizabeth Manley? And yet I hear charming French accent.
"
9161,49,"@terri_to Oh that did sound like him just now! Hmm. Weird. Maybe he offered to hang around! (I hope so because I loooove him.)
"
9162,49,"Oh snap. Broken English throw down from Plushenko! ""If it's not a quad, it's not men's figure skating.""
"
9163,49,"@terri_to Is Pelletier there? I thought they were only doing the pairs. I'm watching CTV and I think it's Elizabeth Manley.
"
9164,49,"Wow, Plushenko is in this to win it. These jumps are huge. As is his v-neck.
"
9165,49,"@amyrhoda Well it squirts you in the eye in an explosion sort of fashion.
"
9166,49,"@amyrhoda Grapefruit?
"
9167,49,"@Doctor_Teeth I don't know, dude, has Weir skated yet?
"
9168,49,"I didn't realise there was a different points system for the Olympics.
"
9169,49,"Well, that was fun. Next up: watch out Switzerland!
"
9170,49,"@martinjhicks Darkwing Duck is your best argument? Weak, man.
"
9171,49,"@lessthanfive They made it NHL sized for the games, because Van couldn't build a new arena with Olympic sized ice.
"
9172,49,"And there are hats on the ice! Damn, those are expensive toques to be tossing.
"
9173,49,"@lauraks ...Make that 8!
"
9174,49,"(You'd think an Oilers fan would know better than to make such pronouncements.)
"
9175,49,"I am feeling pretty confident that Canada is going to take this one, you guys.
"
9176,49,"Holy shit, what a goal. That line is beautiful to watch. I predict my mother got very excited about that goal. (She likes plays like that.)
"
9177,49,"@agrabia My thoughts precisely.
"
9178,49,"You know what is a nice change? Cheering for a really good hockey team. It's been a while! #yesoilersthatmeansyou
"
9179,49,"Guess that answers the questions about whether Getzlaf is healthy.
"
9180,49,"@nikkigrits They're actually gore-tex, just designed to look like jeans.
"
9181,49,"@fuggirls He's actually skating, too - puck handling and everything. I was very pleased to see it.
"
9182,49,"Except people with a duck phobia, I suppose. What's that Far Side joke? Antidaeophobia - fear that somewhere, a duck is watching you.
"
9183,49,"""A lot of Ducks out there!"" Dear Anaheim: your team name is really dumb. Ducks strike fear into nobody's heart.
"
